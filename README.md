# XRD-Data-Extract
During my research on thin films, I performed X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis and received data in .ras files. To analyze this data in Origin, I needed to extract the 2theta and intensity values. To streamline this process, I created a Jupyter notebook for easy extraction of the required data into a new Excel file.
